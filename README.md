## How to Troubleshoot – CompTIA A+ 220-902 – 5.5

### What is a troubleshooting means?
Troubleshooting is a systematic approach to problem-solving that is often used to find and correct issues with complex machines, electronics, computers and software systems

### troubleshooting steps

#### Step 1. Identify the problem.

* Break large problems down into smaller problems.
* Consider scope; who or what is affected?
* Gather details about the issue; ask users, view logs.
* Determine whether anything has changed.
* Duplicate the problem.

#### Step 2. Research.

* Refer to past help desk tickets.
* Search through private or public knowledge bases.
* Ask friends or colleagues.
* Internet search.

#### Step 3. Establish a theory of probable cause.

* Eliminate the simple and obvious possible causes.
* Consider factors that can indirectly cause problems

#### Step 4. Test the theory.

* Change and test only one potential solution at a time.
* Determine the root cause of the issue.
* Escalate the issue to a professional if necessary.

#### Step 5. Establish a plan of action.

* Prepare a specific method to implement the solution.
* Test the plan in an isolated sandboxed environment.
* Notify other users if the solution could possibly affect them.
* Escalate the issue to a professional if necessary.

#### Step 6. Implement or escalate.

* Back up configurations and data first.
* If the problem is complex, monitor implementation progress.

#### Step 7. Verify functionality.

* Ensure the solution has solved the original problem.
* Ensure new problems have not been introduced.
* Consult a subject-matter expert if needed.
* Configure preventative measure if appropriate.

#### Step 8. Document the solution.

* Document the problem and steps taken in the solution.
* Update old documentation with new knowledge.
